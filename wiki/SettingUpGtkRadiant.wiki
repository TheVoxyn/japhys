#summary Guide on how to setup !GtkRadiant so that physics entities can be used.

JAPhys introduces new entities which can be affected by players. By default, !GtkRadiant do not support these entities, so new ones must be added to its _entity definition list_.

The new entities JAPhys introduce are:
 * func_physics
_(This list is subject to change due to early development of JAPhys)_

=Adding the new entities=
 # Open the _mp_entities.def_ file found in _!GameData/base/scripts_.
 # Scroll to the bottom of the file, and add:
{{{

 # Save and close _mp_entities.def_.
 # Open !GtkRadiant, and right-click in the map viewport and check that the new entities are available to use.
